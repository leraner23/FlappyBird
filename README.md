# FlappyBird

A Java GUI-based game built using built-in libraries.

## Overview
FlappyBird is a simple and fun game where you navigate a bird through obstacles by using Space_Bar to make it flap its wings.
The gameplay was inspired by the act of bouncing a ping pong ball against a paddle for as long as possible.
